                Education is a major cause of concern in Pakistan, with many children not having access to quality education. This is due to a lack of schools, trained teachers, and resources in many areas of the country. According to a report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the literacy rate in Pakistan is only 58%, with a significant gap between the literacy rates of men and women. <br><a href="education.html">Read More</a></p>

These women often have limited access to education, job opportunities, and financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to support themselves and their families.

                  One of the main challenges facing widows and housewives is a lack of education and job skills. Many of these women have not had the opportunity to<br><a href="eswh.html">Read More</a></p>

                  Flooding is a major problem in Pakistan, and it causes significant damage to the country's infrastructure and economy.

                <p class="float-left"> Electricity is a major issue in Pakistan, and it is characterized by a lack of supply and high bills. The country has a chronic energy deficit, and power outages are common, especially during peak usage hours. This can affect the functioning of businesses and households and can be a significant burden on the economy. One of the main causes of the electricity problem in Pakistan is a lack of investment in energy infrastructure.<br><a href="bill.html">Read More</a> </p>
