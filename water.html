            <h1>UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM OF PAKISTAN</h1>
            <p>Water scarcity is a major problem in Pakistan, and it is becoming increasingly severe as the population continues to grow. The country's water resources are under tremendous pressure due to a combination of factors such as over-extraction of groundwater, lack of proper water management, and inadequate infrastructure. <br><br>

                One of the main causes of water scarcity in Pakistan is over-extraction of groundwater. The country relies heavily on groundwater as a source of irrigation and drinking water, and over-extraction has led to a decline in groundwater levels and the drying up of wells. This has also led to increased salinity of the remaining groundwater, making it unusable for irrigation and drinking.<br><br>
                
                Another problem is the lack of proper water management. Pakistan's water infrastructure is outdated and inadequate, and there is a lack of proper management and regulation of the country's water resources. This results in wastage and inefficient use of water.<br><br>
                
                Climate change is also exacerbating the water crisis in Pakistan. The country is prone to floods and droughts, and as the global temperature rises, these extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe. This affects the availability and accessibility of water for the population.<br><br>
                
                The water crisis in Pakistan also has a significant impact on the country's agriculture sector. Agriculture is the backbone of Pakistan's economy, and the lack of access to water for irrigation is affecting crop yields and causing food insecurity.<br><br>
                
                To address the water crisis, the government needs to take a multi-pronged approach that includes investing in water infrastructure, implementing proper water management practices, and promoting conservation and efficient use of water. Additionally, the government needs to invest in research and development to find new and innovative ways to address the water crisis, including finding new sources of water, and reusing and recycling of water.<br><br>
                
                In conclusion, water scarcity is a major problem in Pakistan, and it is becoming increasingly severe as the population continues to grow. The country's water resources are under tremendous pressure due to a combination of factors such as over-extraction of groundwater, lack of proper water management, and inadequate infrastructure. The government needs to take a multi-pronged approach to address this crisis, including investing in water infrastructure, implementing proper water management practices, and promoting conservation and efficient use of water.</p>
